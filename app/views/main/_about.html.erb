    Currently on a developer level up quest. My background is in compositing which combines tech, art, and troubleshooting to create something new-- probably why I dig frontend.<br /><br />I've made things using APIs, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS/SCSS, Node + Express, React... basically I'll bungee into the rabbit hole and let the curiosity compass the journey. It's a vast canvas of unknowns, every time you figure something out you add a stroke to that overall picture and *that* is pretty rad.<br /><br />
